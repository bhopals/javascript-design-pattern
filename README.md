### An Overview of JavaScript Design Patterns ###

#### Design Pattern #### 
A general, reusable solution to a commonly occuring problem within a given context in Software Design. In other words, simply a way to resolve a common problem in code.


**Design Pattern Types**
    -   Creational  --> Create new things
    -   Structural  --> Structure your code
    -   Behavioural --> Use for behaviours in code


#### Function as first-class citizens #### 

It means when the function can be treated like a *variable*, meaning they can be passed as arguements to ther functions
as well or can be assigned as a value to a variable OR even returns as a function that means function is a first-class citizen.

```
//1. Assign a function to a variable
    let aNumber = () => {
        return 4*5;
    };
    console.log(aNumber);

//2. Pass a function as an Argumen
    function sayHello() {
        return "Hello, ";
    }
    function greeting(helloMessage, name) {
        console.log(helloMessage() + name);
    }
    // Pass `sayHello` as an argument to `greeting` function
    greeting(sayHello, "JavaScript!");

//3. Return a function
    function sayHello() {
        return function() {
            console.log("Hello!");
        }
    }

```

A function that returns a function is called a **Higher-Order Function**.



#### Callback ####
In a simplest term, a callback is a function that is called inside of another function. In other words,
whenever you pass a function in the arguments and run it inside this function, you are doing the callback pattern.

```
const calc = () => {
    return 4*8;
}

const printCalc = (callback) => {
    console.log(callback());
}

printCalc(calc);

```
